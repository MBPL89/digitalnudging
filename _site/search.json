However, referring uncritically to any form of nudging facilitated by digital technology as digital nudging masks its uniqueness, hampering knowledge accumulation. Our paper advances the discussion by critically reviewing nudging literature in IS to synthesize a typology that highlights the distinct ontology of digital nudges. We clarify the boundary between digital and IT-enabled nudging, reserving digital for nudges that leverage the defining traits of digital objects and digital service stacks. Anchored in the emerging research agenda on digital objects and the increasing focus on ontological reversal in IS, we identify three ideal types of digital nudges: responsive, profile-driven, and environment-aware nudging.\nFor the full paper and detailed typology, go to: …"
